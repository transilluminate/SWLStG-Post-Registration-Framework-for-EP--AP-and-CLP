notes:
  - "The competencies within the framework are presented as two domains and describe the knowledge, skill, behaviour, activity, or outcome that prescribers should demonstrate"
  - "The framework competencies and supporting statements are not in any particular order. The numbering is mainly to support mapping purposes and does not reflect the level of importance of the statement. They are not designed to be used as a script or in isolation as they may overlap with others."
