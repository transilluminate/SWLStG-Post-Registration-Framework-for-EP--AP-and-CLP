# Post-Registration Framework for Enhanced, Advanced and Consultant-level Practice
> South West London and St. George's Mental Health NHS Trust (SWLStG)

This document outlines the strategic framework of describing and assessing *all* practitioners working at post-qualification levels. It encompasses enhanced practice (EP), advanced practice (AP), consultant-level practice (CLP).

Non-medical prescribing (NMP) is included, however, this does not define a level of practice and is woven into the levels according to the practitioner's *scope of practice*.

# Levels of Practice

Summary of the different **levels of practice**:

| PILLAR | ENHANCED | TRAINEE ADVANCED | ADVANCED | CONSULTANT-LEVEL |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. CLINICAL | **Protocol-Guided Specialist:** Delivers high-quality, independent care for specific conditions or tasks within defined boundaries (e.g., NMP within a specific formulary). | **Developing Autonomy:** Developing the ability to manage complete episodes of care and undifferentiated presentations under supervision, moving from protocol to principle. | **Autonomous Management:** Manages complete episodes of care for undifferentiated / complex presentations. Navigates diagnostic uncertainty and risk without direct supervision. | **System Expert:** Helps firmly establish value-based professional practice across pathways, services, and systems. Acts as the ultimate decision-maker for the most complex / high-risk cases. |
| 2. LEADERSHIP | **Local Champion:** Identifies gaps in their own service area and contributes to local change. Role models best practice within the specific clinic/team. | **Emerging Leader:** Demonstrates leadership by initiating Quality Improvement (QI) projects and beginning to question / challenge existing practice boundaries. | **Service Leader:** Leads service improvement, innovation, and team dynamics. Evaluates service effectiveness and drives changes in team culture/delivery| **Strategic Leader:** Works across organizational boundaries (Trust / ICB) to redesign services. Influences strategy, workforce planning, and organizational culture. |
| 3. EDUCATION | **Subject-Specific Educator:** Educates patients and carers. Mentors and supervises colleagues within their specific area of expertise (e.g., "The Diabetes Education Lead"). | **Facilitator of Learning:** Facilitates wider team learning while addressing own gaps. Mentors junior staff across the general pathway. | **Workforce Educator:** Designs local training curricula. Supervises other practitioners. Creates a learning environment for the multidisciplinary team. | **Educational Strategist:** Commissioning and leading education strategy. Working with Universities. Developing the “pipeline” of future talent and supervising the supervisors. |
| 4. RESEARCH | **Evidence User:** Critically appraises evidence to ensure own specific practice is up to date. Participates in audits relevant to their own role. | **Evidence Appraiser:** Translates research into practice. Conducts service audits to benchmark current performance against standards. | **Evidence Translator:** Identifies gaps in evidence, leads audit / evaluation, and implements research findings to change clinical guidelines / protocols. | **Evidence Generator:** Leads formal research, drives impact case studies, and publishes / disseminates findings to influence national / regional policy. |
| 5. CONSULTANCY (ALL 4 PILLARS) | N/A | N/A | N/A – Although some individuals may start working towards generating impact at a more strategic and systems level, and evidencing this for a portfolio of practice. | **Consultancy across all domains, practice to systems level:** establishing expertise across the system by using consultancy approaches and opportunities that have maximum impact on practice, services, communities and populations, and which add to and sustain workforce capacity and capability. |

# The EPA Rating Scale (Universal)

*To be used within the scope of practice and across all workplace assessment forms.*

The Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA) scale moves assessment away from a binary "competent/not competent" to a graded level of required supervision. This allows the same assessment tool to be used for Enhanced, Trainee, and Advanced practitioners—the difference lies in the agreed **Scope of Practice**.

| EPA Level | Description | Scope Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Observed Only** | Not allowed to practice this actvity, even under direct supervision. |
| **2** | **Direct Supervision** | Can act, but the supervisor must be physically present in the vicinity. |
| **3** | **Indirect Supervision** | Supervisor is immediately available (e.g., phone/next door) for guidance; supervisor reviews findings/decisions before they are enacted. |
| **4** | **Unsupervised (Independent)** | **The Standard for Practice.** Can act autonomously within scope. Competent to supervise students or junior staff (e.g., Practice Supervisor/Assessor). |
| **5** | **System Expert / Coordinating Supervisor** | **Formal Sign-off Authority.** Acts as a reference point for the system. Supervises peers or acts as Coordinating Education Supervisor (meets 3yr+ criteria). |

### Guidance: The EPA Scale & Consultant Level

For consultant-level practitioners and experienced advanced practitioners transitioning to consultant-level practice, use these descriptors as a guide to identify those achieving 'level 5':

| Rating | Definition | **Guidance for Consultant Level (Level V)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4** | **Unsupervised (Advanced)** | Competent management. Capable of supervising students or junior staff in this domain. |
| **5** | **Supervisor (Consultant)** | **System Impact:** Managing "wicked problems" where protocols fail. Supervising *other* autonomous practitioners. Fulfills criteria for Coordinating Supervisor roles. |

# Scope of Practice

### Definition

This is the clinical boundary where the practitioner is competent to practice. Instead of a list of drugs or tasks, it is defined by the **clinical domain** (e.g., early intervention in psychosis) and the **patient cohort**. The practitioner is "in scope" if they have the training, the role, and the trust of their supervisor to act.

### Scope of Practice Document

A **scope of practice document** is a tracked document held centrally in the Trust and as part of the practitioner's portfolio.

It should only include the activities that the practitioner has achieved **EPA level 4/5**.

The **Scope of Practice** document should include:
1. **Clinical activities**: including the *clinical domain* and the *patient cohort*.
    * **For NMPs**: this should also include details of the medications, and/or medication classes which the practitioner is competent to prescribe unsupervised.
3. **Clear boundaries**: Any exclusions should be listed, and include the patient groups which fall outside of the scope of practice (e.g., children, multiple comorbidities).
    * **For NMPs**: this should include specific medications if listing mediction classes above.
5. **Reference standards:** An indication of the reference standards they will work within (i.e. key NICE / Trust guidelines etc.)
3. **EPA rating**: an explicit EPA rating should be assigned to each activity. This is to distinguish between 'aspirational' scopes during the training period.
4. **Non-clinical activities**: to address the other pillars of professional practice these should be included if this is a delegated responsibility (responsible for delivering training to X cohort). This does not require an EPA rating.

In addition, any CPD log entries and WBPAs should be kept in the practitioner's portfolio. This is held separately.

### What Happens During Training?

During the training period, the *scope of practice document* can include 'aspirational' activities. These may not be achieved at EPA 4/5. Only the **current achieved** EPA level should be entered into the practitioner's *scope of practice* document.

The practitioner does not *necessarily* need to include activities at EPA 1-3 on their scope to learn something new. They simply operate at EPA level 1-3, acting under supervision for that task. They can gain experience, have feedback, and complete WBPAs to evidence this learning. They must document the decisions and supervision discussions in the clinical notes.

**For NMPs**: the responsibility for the prescription *legally* remains with the individual signing that prescription. If the case is fully discussed with a supervisor, and agreed, clearly documented in the notes, then the practitioner can operate at EPA level 1-3 without this being explicitly defined in their *scope of practice* document. This is to allow working outside of their established independent practice but within scrict supervision requirements.

### Scope of Practice Reviews

A scope of practice is not a static document, it's updated at the annual appraisal with the clinical supervisor. This can be done more frequently, for example during training.

The review process takes into account multiple sources of information, for example, CPD logs, completed WBPAs. In addition a conversation with the practitioner is encouraged. This results in an EPA decision by the supervisor, which is then discussed with the practitioner, and actionable feedback provided.

This is a four step process:

# Workplace-Based Assessments (WBPAs)

Workplace assessments are 'snapshots' in time. They inform the scope of practice reviews.
They assess the *thought processes* (CdB), the *actions* (mini-ACE), their *QI and leadership* activities (QILA), and the *delivery of education* (AEA).

WBPAs are also assessed against the EPA rating, however it is only during the scope of practice reviews where the practitioner's *scope of practice* is determined.

The assessment criteria are mapped to multiple national frameworks and are applicable to all levels of practice.
