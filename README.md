# Post-Registration Framework for Enhanced, Advanced and Consultant-level Practice
> South West London and St. George's Mental Health NHS Trust (SWLStG)

This document outlines the strategic framework of describing and assessing *all* practitioners working at post-qualification levels. It encompasses enhanced practice (EP), advanced practice (AP), consultant-level practice (CLP).

Non-medical prescribing (NMP) is included, however, this does not define a level of practice and is woven into the levels according to the practitioner's *scope of practice*.

## Levels of Practice

Summary of the different **levels of practice**:

| PILLAR | ENHANCED | TRAINEE ADVANCED | ADVANCED | CONSULTANT-LEVEL |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. CLINICAL | **Protocol-Guided Specialist:** Delivers high-quality, independent care for specific conditions or tasks within defined boundaries (e.g., NMP within a specific formulary). | **Developing Autonomy:** Developing the ability to manage complete episodes of care and undifferentiated presentations under supervision, moving from protocol to principle. | **Autonomous Management:** Manages complete episodes of care for undifferentiated / complex presentations. Navigates diagnostic uncertainty and risk without direct supervision. | **System Expert:** Helps firmly establish value-based professional practice across pathways, services, and systems. Acts as the ultimate decision-maker for the most complex / high-risk cases. |
| 2. LEADERSHIP | **Local Champion:** Identifies gaps in their own service area and contributes to local change. Role models best practice within the specific clinic/team. | **Emerging Leader:** Demonstrates leadership by initiating Quality Improvement (QI) projects and beginning to question / challenge existing practice boundaries. | **Service Leader:** Leads service improvement, innovation, and team dynamics. Evaluates service effectiveness and drives changes in team culture/delivery| **Strategic Leader:** Works across organizational boundaries (Trust / ICB) to redesign services. Influences strategy, workforce planning, and organizational culture. |
| 3. EDUCATION | **Subject-Specific Educator:** Educates patients and carers. Mentors and supervises colleagues within their specific area of expertise (e.g., "The Diabetes Education Lead"). | **Facilitator of Learning:** Facilitates wider team learning while addressing own gaps. Mentors junior staff across the general pathway. | **Workforce Educator:** Designs local training curricula. Supervises other practitioners. Creates a learning environment for the multidisciplinary team. | **Educational Strategist:** Commissioning and leading education strategy. Working with Universities. Developing the “pipeline” of future talent and supervising the supervisors. |
| 4. RESEARCH | **Evidence User:** Critically appraises evidence to ensure own specific practice is up to date. Participates in audits relevant to their own role. | **Evidence Appraiser:** Translates research into practice. Conducts service audits to benchmark current performance against standards. | **Evidence Translator:** Identifies gaps in evidence, leads audit / evaluation, and implements research findings to change clinical guidelines / protocols. | **Evidence Generator:** Leads formal research, drives impact case studies, and publishes / disseminates findings to influence national / regional policy. |
| 5. CONSULTANCY (ALL 4 PILLARS) | N/A | N/A | N/A – Although some individuals may start working towards generating impact at a more strategic and systems level, and evidencing this for a portfolio of practice. | **Consultancy across all domains, practice to systems level:** establishing expertise across the system by using consultancy approaches and opportunities that have maximum impact on practice, services, communities and populations, and which add to and sustain workforce capacity and capability. |

# Workplace-Based Assessments (WBPAs)

## **The EPA Rating Scale (Universal)**

*To be used across all four forms.*

The Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA) scale moves assessment away from a binary "competent/not competent" to a graded level of required supervision. This allows the same assessment tool to be used for Enhanced, Trainee, and Advanced practitioners—the difference lies in the agreed **Scope of Practice** (Protocol vs. Principle) and the target EPA level.

| EPA Level | Description | Scope Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Observed Only** | Not allowed to practice this EPA, even under direct supervision. |
| **2** | **Direct Supervision** | Can act, but the supervisor must be physically present in the room/space. |
| **3** | **Indirect Supervision** | Supervisor is immediately available (e.g., phone/next door) for guidance; supervisor reviews findings/decisions before they are enacted. |
| **4** | **Unsupervised (Independent)** | **The Standard for Practice.** Can act autonomously within scope. Competent to supervise students or junior staff (e.g., Practice Supervisor/Assessor). |
| **5** | **System Expert / Coordinating Supervisor** | **Formal Sign-off Authority.** Acts as a reference point for the system. Supervises peers or acts as Coordinating Education Supervisor (meets 3yr+ criteria). |

### Guidance: The EPA Scale & Consultant Level

For consultant-level practitioners and experienced advanced practitioners transitioning to consultant-level practice, use these descriptors as a guide to identify those achieving 'level 5':

| Rating | Definition | **Guidance for Consultant Level (Level V)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4** | **Unsupervised (Advanced)** | Competent management. Capable of supervising students or junior staff in this domain. |
| **5** | **Supervisor (Consultant)** | **System Impact:** Managing "wicked problems" where protocols fail. Supervising *other* autonomous practitioners. Fulfills criteria for Coordinating Supervisor roles. |
